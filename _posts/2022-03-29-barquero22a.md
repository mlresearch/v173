title: Comparison of Spatio-Temporal Models for Human Motion and Pose Forecasting
  in Face-to-Face Interaction Scenarios
abstract: Human behavior forecasting during human-human interactions is of utmost
  importance to provide robotic or virtual agents with social intelligence. This problem
  is especially challenging for scenarios that are highly driven by interpersonal
  dynamics. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of state-of-the-art
  approaches for behavior forecasting. To do so, we leverage whole-body annotations
  (face, body, and hands) from the very recently released UDIVA v0.5, which features
  face-to-face dyadic interactions. Our best attention-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art
  performance in UDIVA v0.5. We show that by autoregressively predicting the future
  with methods trained for the short-term future (<400ms), we outperform the baselines
  even for a considerably longer-term future (up to 2s). We also show that this finding
  holds when highly noisy annotations are used, which opens new horizons towards the
  use of weakly-supervised learning. Combined with large-scale datasets, this may
  help boost the advances in this field.
