title: Automated Methods to Examine Nonverbal Synchrony in Dyads
abstract: Interpersonal synchrony is when two parties in an interaction engage similarly
  due to the rhythmic coordination of their behavioral patterns. The study of synchrony
  in communication and psychology dates back to the 1960s but has evolved over time.
  Historically, studying synchrony has involved the manual coding of nonverbal cues
  by trained human coders, such as counting the occurrence of a specific behavior
  or making subjective ratings about a speaker. However, its time-consuming nature
  has been a serious barrier to the development of the field and has made it difficult
  for new scholars to adopt the technique. Recent advances in automated coding techniques
  allow researchers to collect nonverbal behavioral data effectively and objectively,
  and in a much more efficient manner than laborious manual coding methods historically
  relied upon. This chapter will review some of the theoretical and methodological
  challenges in studying interpersonal synchrony and propose alternatives using automated
  computer vision techniques.
