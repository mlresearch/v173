title: 'Didn’t see that coming: a survey on non-verbal social human behavior forecasting'
abstract: 'Non-verbal social human behavior forecasting has increasingly attracted
  the interest of the research community in recent years. Its direct applications
  to human-robot interaction and socially-aware human motion generation make it a
  very attractive field. In this survey, we define the behavior forecasting problem
  for multiple interactive agents in a generic way that aims at unifying the fields
  of social signals prediction and human motion forecasting, traditionally separated.
  We hold that both problem formulations refer to the same conceptual problem, and
  identify many shared fundamental challenges: future stochasticity, context awareness,
  history exploitation, etc. We also propose a taxonomy that comprises methods published
  in the last 5 years in a very informative way and describes the current main concerns
  of the community with regard to this problem. In order to promote further research
  on this field, we also provide a summarised and friendly overview of audiovisual
  datasets featuring non-acted social interactions. Finally, we describe the most
  common metrics used in this task and their particular issues.'
