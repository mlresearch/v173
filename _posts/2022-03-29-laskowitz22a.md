title: 'Cracking the Code of Live Human Social Interactions in Autism: A Review of
  the Eye-Tracking Literature'
abstract: Human social interaction involves a complex, dynamic exchange of verbal
  and non-verbal information. Over the last decade, eye-tracking technology has afforded
  unique insight into the way eye gaze information, including both holding gaze and
  shifting gaze, organizes live human interactions. For example, while playing a social
  game together, speakers end their turn by directing gaze at the listener, who begins
  to speak with averted gaze (Ho et al., 2015). These findings reflect how eye gaze
  can be used to signal important turn-taking transitions in social interactions.
  Deficits in conversational turn-taking is a core feature of autism spectrum disorders.
  Individuals on the autism spectrum also have notable difficulties processing eye
  gaze information (Griffin {&} Scherf, 2020). A central hypothesis in the literature
  is that the difficulties in processing eye gaze information are foundational to
  the social communication deficits that make social interactions so challenging for
  individuals on the autism spectrum. Although eye-tracking technology has been used
  extensively to assess the way individuals on the spectrum attend to stimuli presented
  on computer screens (for review see Papagiannopoulou et al., 2014), it has rarely
  been used to evaluate the critical question regarding whether and how autistic individuals
  process non-verbal social cues from their partners during live social interactions.
  Here, we review this emerging literature with a focus on characterizing the experimental
  paradigms and eye-tracking procedures to understand the scope (and limitations)
  of research questions and findings. We discuss the theoretical implications of the
  findings from this review and provide recommendations for future work that will
  be essential to understand whether and how fundamental difficulties in perceiving
  and processing information about eye gaze cues interfere with social communication
  skills in autism.
