title: 'ChaLearn LAP Challenges on Self-Reported Personality Recognition and Non-Verbal
  Behavior Forecasting During Social Dyadic Interactions: Dataset, Design, and Results'
abstract: This paper summarizes the 2021 ChaLearn Looking at People Challenge on Understanding
  Social Behavior in Dyadic and Small Group Interactions (DYAD), which featured two
  tracks, self-reported personality recognition and behavior forecasting, both on
  the UDIVA v0.5 dataset. We review important aspects of this multimodal and multiview
  dataset consisting of 145 interaction sessions where 134 participants converse,
  collaborate, and compete in a series of dyadic tasks. We also detail the transcripts
  and body landmark annotations for UDIVA v0.5 that are newly introduced for this
  occasion. We briefly comment on organizational aspects of the challenge before describing
  each track and presenting the proposed baselines. The results obtained by the participants
  are extensively analyzed to bring interesting insights about the tracks tasks and
  the nature of the dataset. We wrap up with a discussion on challenge outcomes, and
  pose several questions that we expect will motivate further scientific research
  to better understand social cues in human-human and human-machine interaction scenarios
  and help build future AI applications for good.
