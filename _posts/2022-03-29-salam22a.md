title: Learning Personalised Models for Automatic Self-Reported Personality Recognition
abstract: Previous research has revealed differences in personality traits among different
  genders, age groups, and even cultures. However, existing methods have focused on
  one-fits-all approaches only and performed personality recognition without taking
  into consideration the userâ€™s profiles. In this paper, we propose to learn personalised
  models of self-reported big five personality traits. Our proposed approach automatically
  learns deep learning architectures for different user profiles using Neural Architecture
  Search (NAS) for predicting the Big Five personality traits from multimodal behavioural
  features. We experiment with two different user profiling criteria, namely, gender
  and age, and compare the results of our approach with the state-of-the-art methods.
  Overall, our results show that personalised models improve the performance as compared
  to the generic model. Particularly, gender-based user profiling combined with bimodal
  features reduces the prediction error by 0.128, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
  on the UDIVA dataset.
