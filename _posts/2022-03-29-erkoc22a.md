title: Skeleton-based Personality Recognition using Laban Movement Analysis
abstract: Personality is expressed through multiple behavioral elements, including
  body movement. Using a feature transformation based on Laban Movement Analysis,
  we present a model for estimating individuals’ Big Five personality traits. Our
  approach achieves higher performance than other methods without exposing image-level
  information to the network, which otherwise can leave the system susceptible to
  bias and result in ethical issues. With the ever-increasing role of computers in
  our daily lives, human-computer interaction and human understanding have become
  significant. Our system enables better human understanding for intelligent agents
  and personal assistants through personality estimation. We utilize Graph Convolutional
  Networks, commonly used for action recognition for this task.
