title: 'Multimodal Sentiment and Personality Perception Under Speech: A Comparison
  of Transformer-based Architectures'
abstract: Human-machine, human-robot interaction, and collaboration appear in diverse
  fields, from homecare to Cyber-Physical Systems. Technological development is fast,
  whereas real-time methods for social communication analysis that can measure small
  changes in sentiment and personality states, including visual, acoustic and language
  modalities are lagging, particularly when the goal is to build robust, appearance
  invariant, and fair methods. We study and compare methods capable of fusing modalities
  while satisfying real-time and invariant appearance conditions. We compare state-of-the-art
  transformer architectures in sentiment estimation and introduce them in the much
  less explored field of personality perception. We show that the architectures perform
  differently on automatic sentiment and personality perception, suggesting that each
  task may be better captured/modeled by a particular method. Our work calls attention
  to the attractive properties of the linear versions of the transformer architectures.
  In particular, we show that the best results are achieved by fusing the different
  architectures{’} preprocessing methods. However, they pose extreme conditions in
  computation power and energy consumption for real-time computations for quadratic
  transformers due to their memory requirements. In turn, linear transformers pave
  the way for quantifying small changes in sentiment estimation and personality perception
  for real-time social communications for machines and robots.
