title: Context-Aware Human Behaviour Forecasting in Dyadic Interactions
abstract: Non-verbal behaviours play an indispensable role in social interaction.
  People tend to use a wide range of non-verbal channels, including eye gaze, body,
  and facial gestures, to communicate their intentions and emotions to their interacting
  partners. Such social signals encourage verbal messages of the communicator can
  be transmitted to other interlocutors in a facile and transparent manner. On the
  other hand, an essential aspect of communication behaviours is the dynamic exchange
  of non-verbal signals among interlocutors for adapting current social norms and
  building a common ground. This factor suggests that data observed from the interacting
  partners should be considered when modeling the target individual’s behaviours.
  Our paper introduces a generative framework with context awareness that captures
  the influence of the interacting partner’s non-verbal signals on the target individual.
  The model consists of three components, namely, Context Encoder, Generator, and
  Discriminator. Context Encoder is employed to extract social signals observed from
  the interacting partner while Generator and Discriminator are utilized to generate
  and optimize the target person’s gestures. We verify the efficiency of the framework
  on two different dyadic interaction datasets. The experimental results demonstrate
  that compared to baselines, our solution can produce human-like gestures better
  supporting interaction contexts. Undoubtedly, in dyadic interaction, the influence
  of the interacting partner’s social signals on the target individual is observable,
  and the proposed approach can efficiently capture those effects. The source code
  of our framework can be found at https://github.com/sairlab/Context-Aware-Human-Behavior-Forecasting.
