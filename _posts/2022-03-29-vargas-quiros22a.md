title: 'Covfee: an extensible web framework for continuous-time annotation of human
  behavior'
abstract: Continuous-time annotation, where subjects annotate data while watching
  the continuous media (video, audio, or time series in general) has traditionally
  been applied to the annotation of continuous-value variables like arousal and valence
  in Affective Computing. On the other hand, machine perception tasks are most often
  annotated using frame-wise techniques. For actions, annotators find the start and
  end frame of the action of interest using a graphical interface. However, given
  the duration of the videos that are generally annotated in social interaction datasets,
  this can be a slow and frustrating process. It usually involves pausing the video
  at the onset or offset of the action and scrolling back and forth to identify the
  precise moment. A continuous annotation system, where annotators are asked to press
  a key when they perceive the target action to be occurring, can improve the time
  to do such annotations, especially in situations where single subjects are annotated
  for long periods of time. Keypoint annotations, where the task is to follow a particular
  point of interest in a video (e.g., a body joint) can also be done continuously.
  In this paper we present the Covfee web framework, a software package designed to
  support online continuous annotation tasks, with crowd-sourcing capabilities. We
  present results from case studies of continuous annotation of body poses (keypoints)
  and speaking (action) on an in-the-wild social interaction dataset. In the case
  of keypoints, we present a new technique allowing an easy way to follow a keypoint
  in a video using the mouse cursor. We found the technique to significantly reduce
  annotation times with no adverse effect on inter-annotator agreement. For action
  annotation, we used continuous annotation techniques to obtain binary speaking status
  labels and annotator ratings of confidence on those labels. Covfee is free software,
  available as a Python package documented at josedvq.github.io/covfee.
